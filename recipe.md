There are two methods you can use:
1.Make during the day which will take about 2.5 hours from start to finish with rising time and glazing time.
2.Allow the dough to rise overnight. Make the dough in the evening. Let it rise in the fridge overnight, then cut and fry them in the morning.

The donut dough is a basic yeast dough that you’ll need to knead and allow to rise. There are three ways to mix this dough:
1.Mix by hand. It’s important that you don’t add too much flour when mixing and kneading by hand. The dough should be tacky. You’ll knead the dough for about 10 minutes.
2.Mix with a stand mixer. You can use the dough hook to knead the dough while you clean up the kitchen. So easy! Do NOT use a hand mixer. Most are not powerful enough to knead dough.
3.Use the dough setting on a bread machine. This is our favorite method…and the easiest! Add the ingredients in the order that your bread maker suggests. About two hours later you’ll have beautifully risen dough. Remove the dough and roll out to cut the shapes you’d like.
Fry in a deep fryer or a large skillet. If you have a deep fryer at home, use it! The benefits of using a small, at-home deep fryer are that it will be easier to control the temperature of the oil and deep fryers usually come with a basket that is handy for safely lowering the the dough into the oil and lifting them back out. If you do not have a deep fryer (It’s ok! We don’t currently have one either.), you can use a large, heavy skillet or Dutch oven on your stove top. 
2.Watch the temperature! Maintaining the correct frying temperature is one of the most important elements of making homemade donuts. 
3.Use the right tool. A heat-resistant tongs, slotted spoon or spatula for flipping them and placing them in the oil.
4.Drain well. As you lift them out of the oil, be sure to allow all excess oil to drip off of the donut, then place them on a wire cooling rack. The wire rack ensures they don’t hold onto extra oil and end up greasy.
5.Be careful! Deep frying requires extreme caution. This is not a job for children and small ones should probably not be in the kitchen while you fry
